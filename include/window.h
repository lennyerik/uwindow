/**
 * @brief Creates an @ref MW_Window object
 *

 * @ref MW_Window_make_current.
 *
 * After calling MW_Window_create, you can start using standard OpenGL functions to draw into it.
 *
 * In case of failure, the function sets the members of the @ref MW_Window structure `window` to NULL, so that another call
 * to MW_Window_create is possible.
 *
 * @param window A pointer to an allocated @ref MW_Window structure. This is usually a pointer to preallocated caller-local memory
 * @param title The title of the window, which may or may not be shown by the window manager
 * @param preferred_width A preferred width that the window should have, in case the window manager does dictate a window size\n
 *                        0 can be passed for a default window width
 * @param preferred_height A preferred height that the window should have, in case the window manager does dictate a window size\n

 * - **MW_INVALID_PARAM**: An invalid parameter was passed to the function
